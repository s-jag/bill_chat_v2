                                 AN ACT


 
  To amend title 38, United States Code, to increase the rate of the 
  special pension payable to Medal of Honor recipients, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medal of Honor Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Medal of Honor is the highest and most prestigious 
        military decoration of the United States.
            (2) To earn the Medal of Honor ``the deed of the person . . 
        . must be so outstanding that it clearly distinguishes his 
        gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms of 
        bravery''.
            (3) The actions of Medal of Honor recipients inspire 
        bravery, and the willingness to give all, in those who serve in 
        the Armed Forces and those who will serve in the future.
            (4) Those listed on the Medal of Honor Roll exemplify the 
        best traits of members of the Armed Forces, a long and proud 
        lineage of those who went beyond the call of duty.
            (5) Pursuant to section 1562 of title 38, United States 
        Code, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall pay monthly to 
        each living person whose name has been entered on the Army, 
        Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard Medal of Honor Roll a special 
        pension.
            (6) Recipients of the Medal of Honor have earned a 
        substantial and historic increase to such special pension in 
        recognition of their conspicuous gallantry, unwavering 
        commitment, and heroic actions above and beyond the call of 
        duty.

              PAYABLE TO MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS.

                    (C) by adding at the end the following new 
                subparagraph:
    ``(B) The rate described in this subparagraph is equal to the 
amount of monthly compensation paid to a veteran without dependents 
under subsection (m) of section 1114 of this title, increased to the 
next intermediate rate under subsection (p) of such section.''; and
            (2) in subsection (e)--

                    (B) by inserting ``, subject to paragraph (2),'' 
                before ``shall''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following new 
                paragraph (2):
    ``(2) The Secretary shall not, under paragraph (1), increase the 
amount of monthly special pension payable under subsection (a) in a
