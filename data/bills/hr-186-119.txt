                                 AN ACT


 
To authorize the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to establish 
 a commemorative work on the National Mall to honor the extraordinary 
 acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice displayed by Medal of 
                           Honor recipients.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hershel `Woody' Williams National 
Medal of Honor Monument Location Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress in 2021 unanimously passed, and the President 
        signed, Public Law 117-80 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note), which 
        authorized the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to 
        establish on Federal land in the District of Columbia a 
        commemorative work to honor the acts of valor, selfless 
        service, and sacrifice displayed by Medal of Honor recipients.
            (2) The Medal of Honor was established by President Abraham 
        Lincoln and first awarded 160 years ago on March 25, 1863, and 
        is part of Lincoln's lasting and living legacy.
            (3) In 1991, during the administration of President George 
        H.W. Bush, this legacy was extended further when National Medal 
        of Honor Day was established as March 25th of each year.
            (4) The Medal of Honor is awarded to all branches of the 
        United States Armed Forces as our nation's highest recognition 
        for valor in combat.
            (5) The number of living Medal of Honor recipients has been 
        steadily declining, making it even more crucial to honor and 
        recognize their heroic sacrifices and inspire future 
        generations.
            (6) Hershel ``Woody'' Williams, the last World War II Medal 
        of Honor recipient, passed away in 2022 and laid in honor at 
        the United States Capitol.
            (7) The Medal of Honor represents the very best of our 
        Nation--ordinary citizens, who took extraordinary action above 
        and beyond the call of duty and became heroes of our Republic.
            (8) These examples inspire all citizens and ignite within 
        us the very spirit of America.
            (9) The Medal of Honor rises to the level of supreme 
        national and historical importance necessary to warrant 
        representation on the National Mall.
            (10) Locating the National Medal of Honor Monument in close 
        proximity to the Lincoln Memorial within the Reserve would be a 
        respectful extension of his enduring legacy and recognition of 
        what ordinary people can accomplish when working for the 
        greater good.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR MONUMENT LOCATION.

Reserve (as defined in section 8902(a) of title 40, United States 
Code).
    (b) Applicability of Commemorative Works Act.--Except as provided 
in subsection (a), chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code (commonly
