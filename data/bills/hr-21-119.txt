    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) If an abortion results in the live birth of an infant, 
        the infant is a legal person for all purposes under the laws of 
        the United States, and entitled to all the protections of such 
        laws.
            (2) Any infant born alive after an abortion or within a 
        hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the 
        protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for 
        any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility 
        for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient 
        within its care.
    (b) Constitutional Authority.--In accordance with the above 
findings, Congress enacts the following pursuant to Congress' power 
under--
            (1) section 5 of the 14th Amendment, including the power to 
        enforce the prohibition on government action denying equal 
        protection of the laws; and
            (2) section 8 of article I to make all laws necessary and 
        proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the 
        Constitution of the United States, including the power to 
        regulate commerce under clause 3 of such section.
