H. Res. 189

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                         March 6, 2025.
Whereas on March 4, 2025, during the joint session of Congress convened pursuant 
        to House Concurrent Resolution 11, the President of the United States, 
        speaking at the invitation of the House and Senate, had his remarks 
        interrupted by the Representative from Texas, Mr. Green;
Whereas the conduct of the Representative from Texas disrupted the proceedings 
        of the joint address and was a breach of proper conduct; and
Whereas after numerous disruptions, the Representative from Texas had to be 
        removed from the chamber by the Sergeant at Arms: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) Representative Al Green be censured;
            (2) Representative Al Green forthwith present himself in the well of 
        the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; and
            (3) Representative Al Green be censured with the public reading of 
        this resolution by the Speaker.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
