SEC. 210. UNITED STATES TREATMENT OF DOUBLE TAXATION MATTERS WITH 
              RESPECT TO TAIWAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States addresses issues with respect to 
        double taxation with foreign countries by entering into 
        bilateral income tax conventions (known as tax treaties) with 
        such countries, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate 
        to ratification pursuant to article II of the Constitution.
            (2) The United States has entered into more than sixty such 
        tax treaties, which facilitate economic activity, strengthen 
        bilateral cooperation, and benefit United States workers, 
        businesses, and other United States taxpayers.
            (3) Due to Taiwan's unique status, the United States is 
        unable to enter into an article II tax treaty with Taiwan, 
        necessitating an agreement to address issues with respect to 
        double taxation.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
to--
            (1) provide for additional bilateral tax relief with 
        respect to Taiwan, beyond that provided for in section 894A of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by the United 
        States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act), only after 
        entry into force of an Agreement, as provided for in section 
        205, and only in a manner consistent with such Agreement; and
            (2) continue to provide for bilateral tax relief with 
        sovereign states to address double taxation and other related 
        matters through entering into bilateral income tax conventions, 
        subject to the Senate's advice and consent to ratification 
        pursuant to article II of the Constitution.

            Passed the House of Representatives January 15, 2025.
