   To amend title 28, United States Code, to limit the authority of 
 district courts to provide injunctive relief, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025'' as 
the ``NORRA of 2025''.

SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY OF UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS TO 
              PROVIDE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 1370. Limitation on authority to provide injunctive relief
    ``(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, no United States district court shall issue any 
order providing for injunctive relief, except in the case of such an 
order that is applicable only to limit the actions of a party to the 
case before such district court with respect to the party seeking 
injunctive relief from such district court and non-parties represented 
by such a party acting in a representative capacity pursuant to the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    ``(b) If a case is brought by two or more States located in 
different circuits challenging an action by the executive branch, that 
case shall be referred to a three-judge panel selected pursuant to 
section 2284, except that the selection of judges shall be random, and 
not by the chief judge of the circuit. The three-judge panel may issue 
an injunction that would otherwise be prohibited under subsection (a), 
and shall consider the interest of justice, the risk of irreparable 
harm to non-parties, and the preservation of the constitutional 
separation of powers in determining whether to issue such an order.
    ``(c) An appeal of an order granting or denying injunctive relief 
pursuant to subsection (b) may lie to the circuit embracing the 
district or to the Supreme Court, at the preference of the party.''.
    (b) Table of Sections.--The table of sections for such chapter is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

``1370. Limitation on authority to provide injunctive relief.''.

            Passed the House of Representatives April 9, 2025.

            Attest:
