# Engineering Guide: Implementing a RAG-Powered Chat System for Congressional Bills 
We build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation backend step-by-step, inspired by ZeroEntropy’s architecture, but tailored to a specific use case and using mostly open-source components. Our goal is a system that can answer questions about **U.S. congressional bills**, with the data stored in Firebase. This system will serve a chat interface where users select a bill and ask questions about its contents. We’ll cover everything from data ingestion (getting bill text and chunking it) to setting up a vector database for retrieval, to integrating with an LLM to generate answers. 

For context, congressional bills are typically long documents with formal structure (sections, subsections, etc.), somewhat akin to legal text. Users might ask things like “What does Section 5 of this bill say?” or “Does this bill mention solar energy tax credits?”. We want our system to retrieve the relevant sections of the bill and provide them to the language model to answer the user’s question accurately.

We’ll assume we have access to OpenAI or Anthropic’s API for the language model (for final answer generation and possibly for chunking), as the user indicated they will provide those. Everything else we’ll do with open-source or free tools.

**Outline:** 
1. **Data Retrieval from Firebase** – getting the text of the bills.
2. **Document Chunking** – splitting each bill into semantically meaningful chunks (using a method similar to LlamaChunk).
3. **Embedding and Indexing** – creating vector embeddings for chunks and storing them in a vector database (we’ll use an open-source solution like Qdrant, along with optionally a basic keyword index for hybrid search).
4. **Backend Query Endpoint** – writing the logic to accept a user query + bill ID, perform retrieval (with potential filtering), and call the LLM to produce an answer.
5. **Prompt Design for QA** – constructing the prompt that feeds retrieved text to the LLM effectively (including examples of system instructions and user prompts).
6. **Integration and Testing** – how to wrap this into an API (e.g., a Flask app or Firebase Cloud Function) and test it with example questions.
7. **Foresight** – considerations for improvement, scaling, and ensuring accuracy (tying back to ZeroEntropy-like eval).

Throughout, we’ll use inline code and comments to clarify each step. Let’s get started.

## 1. Data Ingestion from Firebase 
First, we need the text of the congressional bills. Suppose the bills are stored in Firebase Firestore, each document containing the bill text or a reference to it. It’s common to store large text in Firebase Storage (as text files or PDFs) and store a URL or path in Firestore. For this guide, let’s assume we have the full text in Firestore (for example, a field `text` in a `bills` collection). If instead we have PDFs, we’d need an OCR or PDF parsing step (using a library like PyMuPDF or PDFMiner) – which is doable but for simplicity, let’s assume we already have plain text.

We will use the Firebase Admin SDK in Python to fetch the data. Here’s a conceptual snippet:
```python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

# Initialize Firebase Admin (you need service account credentials JSON)
cred = credentials.Certificate("path/to/firebaseCreds.json")
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
db = firestore.client()

# Fetch all bills (or a specific subset)
bills_ref = db.collection('bills')
bills = {}
for doc in bills_ref.stream():
    data = doc.to_dict()
    bill_id = data.get('bill_id') or doc.id  # use either a field or document ID as bill_id
    text = data['text']
    bills[bill_id] = text
    print(f"Fetched bill {bill_id} with {len(text)} characters.")
```
This code connects to Firestore, reads each document in the `bills` collection, and stores the bill text in a Python dictionary `bills`. Each entry is keyed by `bill_id` (which could be something like “HR1234” or an auto ID) with the entire text as value.

If the data is in another form (like one giant JSON or CSV), adapt accordingly. The main goal is to have a `bills` dictionary mapping an ID to the raw text content.

**Preprocessing Text:** Bill texts often have numbered sections, indentation, etc. We might want to normalize certain things:
- Remove line numbers or extra whitespace.
- Ensure each section heading (e.g., "SEC. 5.") is on its own line for easier splitting.
We can do simple normalization like:
```python
import re

for bill_id, text in bills.items():
    # Remove form feeds or weird characters
    text = text.replace("\f", " ")
    # Normalize multiple newlines to just one
    text = re.sub(r'\n\s*\n+', '\n\n', text)
    bills[bill_id] = text
```
This just cleans up blank lines.

Now we have the text ready for chunking.

## 2. Document Chunking 
Following ZeroEntropy’s lead, we want to chunk each bill into semantically coherent pieces. Congressional bills have a hierarchical structure typically:
- They often start with a title, then sections labeled “Section 1, Section 2, ...” or “SEC. 1. ...”.
- Sections can have subsections labeled (a), (b), etc., and further subclauses (i), (ii), etc.

An ideal chunk might be a section or a subsection, depending on length. We want each chunk to be a few hundred words at most (so it fits in an LLM context easily along with others), but not cut in the middle of a sentence or concept.

**Approach A: LLM-based Chunking (LlamaChunk style)** – We can use an LLM like GPT-4 to insert delimiters. This will yield high-quality chunks at the cost of some API usage.

**Approach B: Rule-based with structure** – Because bills have clear section markers ("SEC. X."), we could split on those, then possibly split further if a section is very long by subsections.

For a robust solution, we might combine B and A:
- First split by top-level section headings (to break the bill into manageable parts).
- Then within each part, if it’s still large or has complex structure, use GPT-4 to insert fine-grained breaks.

Given the user is okay with using OpenAI API, and quality is a priority, we’ll demonstrate Approach A fully (and note where one could do B if needed).

**Using GPT-4 for Chunking:** We will prompt GPT-4 to insert a special token (e.g., “§§” or any token not in the text) at chunk boundaries. We'll use "§§" (double section sign) as our delimiter. We assume the text isn't using that combination normally.

Prompt design:
- System message: “You are a text segmentation assistant. Insert the token '§§' at points in the text where it can be logically split into self-contained sections or paragraphs that each cover a distinct topic or provision. Do not otherwise alter the text.”
- User message: The bill text (or a portion of it if very long).

We have to be mindful of token limits. If a bill is extremely long (say 100 pages), GPT-4 8k might not handle it in one go. GPT-4 32k could, but if not available, we’d split input. Perhaps feed it one section at a time if needed.

For illustration, we’ll do it section by section:
```python
import openai

def chunk_text_with_gpt(text):
    # Call GPT-4 to insert chunk delimiters in the text
    system_prompt = "You are a document chunker. Insert the token \"§§\" in the text below to indicate where it should be split into self-contained, semantically coherent chunks. Ensure that each chunk is a complete section or idea."
    # (We keep the instruction concise. We assume the text is within GPT context limit)
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                  {"role": "user", "content": text}]
    )
    chunked_text = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    return chunked_text

# Example for one bill (in practice, loop over all bills)
bill_id = list(bills.keys())[0]
text = bills[bill_id]
chunked_text = chunk_text_with_gpt(text)
chunks = chunked_text.split("§§")
print(f"Bill {bill_id} split into {len(chunks)} chunks.")
```
This would send the entire text of one bill to GPT-4. If that text is too large, one strategy:
- Find section boundaries via regex (e.g., split by "SEC. " headings) and process each section separately through GPT for internal chunking.
- Then recombine the chunk markers.

For brevity, assume the bill fits (many bills might be 10-50 pages, which GPT-4 32k could handle, or we feed in parts sequentially).

After this, `chunks` is a list of chunk strings for that bill. We should trim them and filter empty entries:
```python
chunks = [chunk.strip() for chunk in chunks if chunk.strip()]
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks[:3]):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk[:100]}...")
```
This prints first 100 chars of first 3 chunks as a sanity check.

If not using GPT, an alternative code could be:
```python
# Rule-based chunk: split by "SEC. " and keep sections as chunks for simplicity
chunks = text.split(r'SEC.')
chunks = ["SEC." + c for c in chunks if c.strip()]  # add back 'SEC.' and remove empties
```
But that might yield chunks too large if a section is very long with many subsections. So one might further split sections by subsections:
```python
subchunks = []
for c in chunks:
    # split by subsection letters followed by two spaces (assuming format " (a) ")
    parts = re.split(r'\n\s*\([a-z]\)\s', c)
    if len(parts) > 1:
        # reattach the subsection label to each part
        for j, part in enumerate(parts):
            if part.strip() == "":
                continue
            if j == 0:
                subchunks.append(part.strip())
            else:
                subsection_label = chr(ord('a') + j - 1)  # 'a', 'b', etc.
                subchunks.append(f"({subsection_label}) {part.strip()}")
    else:
        subchunks.append(c.strip())
chunks = subchunks
```
This is heuristic and may not capture nested sub-subsections, but gives an idea. Because we prefer GPT chunking for better results, I won’t elaborate further on the rule-based approach here, but it’s an option if avoiding API calls.

So at the end of chunking, for each bill `bill_id`, we have a list of `chunks`. It’s good to assign each chunk a unique ID (like `bill_id` plus an index):
```python
bill_chunks = []  # to accumulate all chunks with their IDs and bill metadata
for bill_id, text in bills.items():
    chunked_text = chunk_text_with_gpt(text)
    chunks = [c.strip() for c in chunked_text.split("§§") if c.strip()]
    for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        chunk_id = f"{bill_id}::chunk{idx}"
        bill_chunks.append({
            "id": chunk_id,
            "bill_id": bill_id,
            "text": chunk
        })
    print(f"{bill_id}: {len(chunks)} chunks")
```
We store each chunk with an `id` (combining bill id and chunk number) and keep track of which bill it belongs to. This will help with filtering later (so we only search within the selected bill).

## 3. Embedding and Indexing the Chunks 
Now we need to index these chunks for retrieval. We will use an **embedding model** to convert each chunk to a vector, and store these vectors in a **vector database** that supports similarity search and filtering by bill_id.

**Embedding Model:** Since we are avoiding closed APIs for embedding, we can use a Hugging Face model like `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or a larger one like `all-mpnet-base-v2` for better quality. Let's use `all-mpnet-base-v2` as a good trade-off (768-dimensional vectors, good general semantic performance).

```python
!pip install sentence-transformers qdrant-client
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

embedder = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2')
# For demonstration, embed a small sample to ensure it's working:
vec = embedder.encode("Test embedding for a chunk of text.")
print(f"Vector dimension: {len(vec)}")
```

This loads the embedding model. Next, we will initialize a **Qdrant** vector database. Qdrant can run as a service or in-memory via its client for small data. We’ll use the in-memory mode for simplicity.

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import VectorParams, Distance

# Initialize in-memory Qdrant instance
qdrant = QdrantClient(":memory:")
# Create a collection for bill chunks
vector_size = embedder.get_sentence_embedding_dimension()
qdrant.recreate_collection(
    collection_name="bill_chunks",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=vector_size, distance=Distance.COSINE)
)
```

We set `distance=Distance.COSINE` for cosine similarity (since our embeddings are not unit-length by default, Qdrant will handle normalization for cosine).

Now, we add all chunk vectors to the collection with their payload (metadata). The payload can include the `bill_id` and maybe chunk text or other info. It’s usually wise to store the chunk text or an identifier so we can retrieve or display it after search.

However, storing the full text in payload might bloat memory. Since we have `bill_chunks` list already in Python, we could store just IDs and keep the actual text in a Python dict. But if we want the system to be scalable or persistent, we might store the text in Qdrant (Qdrant can store payloads of moderate size easily). For demonstration, we’ll store text in payload as well. 

```python
# Prepare points to upload
points = []
for chunk in bill_chunks:
    vec = embedder.encode(chunk["text"])
    # Each point: (id, vector, payload)
    payload = {"bill_id": chunk["bill_id"], "text": chunk["text"]}
    points.append((chunk["id"], vec, payload))
# Upsert in batches (to avoid too large single request if many chunks)
batch_size = 100
for i in range(0, len(points), batch_size):
    batch = points[i:i+batch_size]
    qdrant.upsert(collection_name="bill_chunks", points=batch)
print(f"Indexed {len(points)} chunks in vector DB.")
```

We now have a vector index of all chunks, each labeled with which bill it comes from. This means we can perform filtered searches like “search within bill X’s chunks only” by using `bill_id` as a filter.

**(Optional)**: If we wanted a hybrid approach, we could also index something in a full-text search. Qdrant doesn’t do BM25 itself, but we could quickly implement a fallback: e.g., we could maintain a simple dictionary of `bill_id -> [chunk texts]` and do a keyword search ourselves (like if a query contains a rare term, ensure any chunk containing that term is considered). For brevity, we won’t implement a full BM25 here, but it’s something that could improve certain queries (like if someone searches exact phrases or numbers, etc.).

However, since our domain is specific and we assume semantic search plus possibly metadata filtering will suffice for a baseline, we proceed with just vector search.

## 4. Retrieval and Query Handling 
Now the core function: given a user’s query and a selected bill, retrieve the relevant chunks from that bill and prepare them for the LLM.

We will create a function `retrieve_chunks(bill_id, query, top_k)` that:
- Embeds the query using the same embedder.
- Searches the Qdrant index for the top_k most similar chunks where `bill_id` matches the given bill.
- Returns those chunks (or their texts).

Qdrant’s Python client allows filtering in the search call via a `filter` parameter. We can filter by `{"bill_id": bill_id}` easily.

```python
def retrieve_chunks(bill_id, query, top_k=5):
    # Embed the user query
    query_vec = embedder.encode(query)
    # Perform vector search in collection with a filter on bill_id
    hits = qdrant.search(
        collection_name="bill_chunks",
        query_vector=query_vec,
        query_filter={"must": [{"key": "bill_id", "match": {"value": bill_id}}]},
        limit=top_k
    )
    # 'hits' are ScoredPoint objects with .payload and .score
    results = []
    for hit in hits:
        snippet = hit.payload.get("text")
        score = hit.score  # higher means more similar since we use cosine
        results.append((snippet, score))
    return results

# Example usage:
example_bill = list(bills.keys())[0]
query = "What is the short title of this bill?"
snippets = retrieve_chunks(example_bill, query, top_k=3)
for snip, score in snippets:
    print(f"Score {score:.3f}: {snip[:80]}...")
```

The output might be something like:
```
Score 0.912: "Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the 'Energy Independence Act of 2025'."
Score 0.805: "This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment..."
Score 0.654: "Findings.—Congress finds that..."
```
We see the top snippet is clearly the short title clause. The others are less relevant, but still from the bill.

If our chunking worked well, the short title is isolated in one chunk, so the similarity should be high for that chunk given the query mentions "short title". 

We might also consider **keyword filtering**: If a query explicitly mentions a section (e.g., "Section 5"), semantic search might not prioritize that because numbers might not heavily influence embeddings. In such cases, we can add a step: if query matches a pattern like “Section X” or “SEC. X”, we could directly fetch the chunk that starts with that section (since our chunks likely preserve “SEC. X” at start). We can implement a quick check:
```python
import re

def retrieve_chunks(bill_id, query, top_k=5):
    # If query references a specific section number, prioritize that section chunk
    sec_match = re.search(r'\b[Ss]ection\s+(\d+)\b', query)
    explicit_section_chunk = None
    if sec_match:
        sec_num = sec_match.group(1)
        # find chunk that likely is Section sec_num
        hits = qdrant.search(
            collection_name="bill_chunks",
            query_vector=embedder.encode("Section "+sec_num),
            query_filter={"must": [{"key": "bill_id", "match": {"value": bill_id}}]},
            limit=1
        )
        if hits:
            explicit_section_chunk = hits[0].payload.get("text")
    # Normal semantic search
    query_vec = embedder.encode(query)
    hits = qdrant.search(
        collection_name="bill_chunks",
        query_vector=query_vec,
        query_filter={"must": [{"key": "bill_id", "match": {"value": bill_id}}]},
        limit=top_k
    )
    results = []
    seen_texts = set()
    if explicit_section_chunk:
        results.append(explicit_section_chunk)
        seen_texts.add(explicit_section_chunk)
    for hit in hits:
        snippet = hit.payload.get("text")
        if snippet not in seen_texts:
            results.append(snippet)
            seen_texts.add(snippet)
    return results[:top_k]
```
Here, if a specific "Section X" is mentioned, we do a quick search for that section chunk (we cheat by embedding "Section X" and searching; we could also iterate through chunks of that bill in memory to find one starting with "Section X"). We then add that chunk at the top of results, ensuring it’s included. Then we do normal search and merge results (skipping duplicates).

This is a form of a simple heuristic agentic step: it catches a pattern and ensures it's handled.

Now, after retrieval, we have typically 3-5 snippet texts relevant to the query (all from the same bill). 

## 5. Constructing the LLM Prompt and Generating Answer 
The final step is to feed these snippets to an LLM along with the question, and ask it to answer using them. Essentially, we’ll give the LLM a message like: “Here are some relevant excerpts from Bill X. Answer the question using these excerpts.”

**Choosing an LLM:** We will assume OpenAI’s GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 if cost is an issue) via API. The user can provide the API key. Alternatively, if we wanted open-source, one could use a local Llama2 13B with context length ~4k tokens. But its quality may be lower. Since user is okay using OpenAI, we’ll use that for best accuracy.

**Prompt Design:** We want to strongly instruct the model to base its answer on the text only, not to hallucinate beyond it. Also, maybe to include section references if useful.

We can do a system message like:
```
"You are a helpful assistant for answering questions about U.S. congressional bills. 
You will be given excerpts from a bill and a question. 
Answer the question solely based on the provided text, quoting or referencing the text as needed. 
If the answer is not in the provided excerpts, say you do not have that information."
```
This ensures it stays grounded.

User message can contain the context and question. We might format the snippets with labels like “Excerpt 1, Excerpt 2” or as bullet points. This helps the model distinguish them and possibly cite them (“According to Excerpt 1, ...”).

For example:
```
USER:
**Bill**: H.R. 123 – Energy Independence Act of 2025.

**Relevant Excerpts**:
1. "Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the 'Energy Independence Act of 2025'."
2. "Renewable Energy Tax Credit.—The Secretary shall provide a 30% tax credit for solar energy installations..."
3. "Effective Date.—This Act shall take effect 180 days after its enactment."

**Question**: What is the short title of this bill?
```
The assistant should answer: “The short title of the bill is the 'Energy Independence Act of 2025' ([LlamaChunk: A General and Cost Efficient Approach to Semantic Chunking | by ZeroEntropy | Medium](https://medium.com/@zeroentropy/llamachunk-a-general-and-cost-efficient-approach-to-semantic-chunking-c9d9992b4a12#:~:text=Processing%20450%2C000%20characters%20took%20about,450%2C000%20characters%20if%20done%20optimally)).” (It might not include the citation, but at least it uses the snippet content.)

We should ensure not to exceed token limit: if snippets are large, maybe truncate or summarize them in the prompt. But in our case, 5 snippets of a few hundred chars each + question is likely within a couple thousand tokens, fine for GPT-4.

Let’s code the call:
```python
def answer_query_with_snippets(bill_id, query, model="gpt-4"):
    snippets = retrieve_chunks(bill_id, query, top_k=5)
    # Construct the prompt
    system_msg = (
        "You are an expert assistant for answering questions about U.S. congressional bills.\n"
        "You will be given excerpts from a bill and a question. Answer the question based ONLY on the provided excerpts.\n"
        "If the answer is not in the excerpts, say you cannot find that information.\n"
        "If applicable, include the section number or quote from the excerpts in your answer."
    )
    user_msg = "Bill ID: {}\n\nRelevant Excerpts:\n".format(bill_id)
    for i, snippet in enumerate(snippets, start=1):
        user_msg += f"{i}. \"{snippet}\"\n"
    user_msg += f"\nQuestion: {query}"
    # Call OpenAI ChatCompletion
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": system_msg},
                  {"role": "user", "content": user_msg}]
    )
    answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    return answer

# Example:
answer = answer_query_with_snippets(example_bill, "What is the short title of this bill?")
print("Answer:", answer)
```

The answer ideally: *“The short title of the bill is the 'Energy Independence Act of 2025.'”* – which directly uses Excerpt 1.

If the user asks something not in snippets, e.g. “Who introduced this bill?” and our snippets don’t contain that (since it might be in metadata but not text), the answer should be: *“I’m sorry, I cannot find that information in the provided text.”* Because our system doesn’t have it. This aligns with our instruction to not hallucinate.

**Integration**: We can wrap this in a web service. For instance, using Flask:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/query_bill", methods=["POST"])
def query_bill():
    data = request.get_json()
    bill_id = data.get("bill_id")
    question = data.get("question")
    if not bill_id or not question:
        return jsonify({"error": "bill_id and question are required"}), 400
    answer = answer_query_with_snippets(bill_id, question, model="gpt-4")
    return jsonify({"bill_id": bill_id, "question": question, "answer": answer})
```
We would run this Flask app (ensuring we set the OpenAI API key in environment). The front-end could then POST `{"bill_id": "HR123", "question": "Does this bill provide tax credits for solar energy?"}` and get back an answer JSON.

Since the user specifically mentioned Firebase, we might implement this as a Firebase Cloud Function in Node or use Flask on Cloud Run. But the language doesn’t matter; the logic remains: fetch from vector DB, call LLM.

**Testing**: Let’s simulate a couple queries manually with our Python setup (imagine the above functions defined and openai API key set).

Example queries:
- “What is the short title of this bill?” – we expect it to find the snippet and answer with the short title.
- “Does the bill provide any tax credits for solar energy?” – our chunk above had "30% tax credit for solar energy installations". The retrieval should fetch that and the answer might be: “Yes, Section X provides a 30% tax credit for solar energy installations.” Possibly quoting it.

- “When does the act take effect?” – We have an “Effective Date” chunk, so it should answer “180 days after enactment.”

By ensuring our retrieval is strong (thanks to chunking and filtering) and our prompt restricts to given text, we’ll likely get accurate answers for these.

This step-by-step guide mirrors ZeroEntropy’s pipeline: 
1. ingest (we did via Firebase),
2. chunk (we used GPT-4, analogous to LlamaChunk),
3. embed + store (we used a vector model and Qdrant),
4. retrieve with possible multi-step logic (we added a specific section catch, akin to an agentic behavior, and used semantic search),
5. final LLM answer with instructions to not hallucinate.

**Open-Source vs Closed Tools:** We used OpenAI’s API for chunking and answering because of quality. To go fully open-source, one could:
- Use a local Llama2 7B/13B for chunking (maybe fine-tune it to insert a delimiter – or just prompt it similarly if it fits the text).
- Use an open embedding model (we did).
- Use an open LLM for QA. For instance, one could try Llama2 13B chat with the context. It might work for straightforward questions, but might struggle with precise legal language or might not be as reliable in saying "I don't know." There’s also the new **Claude 2** (Anthropic) which is closed but known for 100k context – could ingest an entire bill without chunking! But we assume we’re not using Anthropics in this particular open-source tilt.

Our approach already avoids proprietary stuff except OpenAI for chunk & answer. If those are allowed (the user said they’d provide API for OpenAI/Anthropic), that’s fine. If not, one could substitute with local model calls (perhaps using HuggingFace transformers pipeline for a chat model). The output might not be as polished, though.

**Wrap-Up:** We should consider evaluating this system. We don’t have a LegalBench for bills, but we could craft a few Q&A pairs ourselves to test. For example, parse the bill manually for key facts and test queries on them. This is similar to how ZeroEntropy used LegalBench-RAG. If a discrepancy is found, we could refine:
- If a certain answer isn’t found due to chunking, perhaps refine chunk length.
- If the LLM gives an incorrect answer despite having the snippet (rare if prompt is good), maybe emphasize quoting the text.

Our design also easily allows adding more data (just index new bills) or scaling (Qdrant can scale out-of-memory, and we can host the embedder and LLM as needed).

We’d also integrate caching if needed: e.g., cache embeddings of common queries or reuse the fact that multiple questions about the same bill could reuse the same index (which we already have loaded). If using an API like OpenAI, we might want to minimize calls (e.g., if user is in a multi-turn chat, we might reuse previous retrieval results if context hasn’t changed, etc.). Those are optimizations beyond basic scope.

Thus, we have an end-to-end blueprint:
1. **Data ingestion** from Firebase Firestore,
2. **LLM-assisted chunking** for semantic segmentation,
3. **Embedding & vector indexing** with Qdrant (open source),
4. **Agentic retrieval logic** (small bit for section handling, can be extended),
5. **LLM query answering with provided context** (with careful prompt to ensure fidelity).

This setup, inspired by ZeroEntropy’s methods, can significantly improve accuracy of answers in our congressional bill chatbot. The system will quote the bill’s text for answers, making the responses transparent and trustworthy, which is crucial for users (e.g., policy analysts, lawyers, or citizens reading bills).

In the next section, we’ll discuss some **business foresight and strategic considerations** for ZeroEntropy itself – how can they improve further, and how do they stand relative to other solutions like Contextual AI or LangChain, to put our work in context.
